     <p id="vogue">VOGUE; Vogue is an American monthly fashion and lifestyle magazine covering many topics, including culture, living, and runway. Based in New York City, it began as a weekly newspaper in 1892, before becoming a monthly magazine years later.
    The British Vogue, launched in 1916, was the first international edition, while the Italian version Vogue Italia has been called the top fashion magazine in the world.[2] As of today, there are 26 international editions.</p>

       STYLE AND INFLUENCE; The word vogue means "style" in French. Vogue was described by book critic Caroline Weber in a December 2006 edition of The New York Times as "the world's most influential fashion magazine":[25] The publication claims to reach 11 million readers in the US and 12.5 million internationally.[42][43] Furthermore, Anna Wintour was described as one of the most powerful figures in fashion.

    <p> ECONOMIC; Wintour's "Fashion Night" initiative was launched in 2009 with the intention of kickstarting the economy following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, by drawing people back into the retail environment and donating proceeds to various charitable causes. The event was co-hosted by Vogue in 27 cities around the US and 15 countries worldwide, and included online retailers at the beginning of 2011.[47] Debate occurred over the actual profitability of the event in the US, resulting in a potentially permanent hiatus in 2013; however, the event continues in 19 other locations internationally.[48] Vogue also has the ability to lift the spirits of readers during tough times and revels that "even in bad times, someone is up for a good time." The article states that Vogue "make[s] money because they elevate the eye and sometimes the spirit, take the reader someplace special."[49][45] These fantasy tomes feel a boost during economic distress—like liquor and ice cream and movie ticket sales."</p>
     <p id="social"> SOCIAL; The Met Gala is an annual event that is hosted by Vogue to celebrate the opening of the Metropolitan Museum's fashion exhibit.
